Native implementation of yeetsort for various languages. Backstory: youtube.com/watch?v=2Bjy5YQ5xPc

This was actually somewhat helpful as an exercise in reminding myself of languages I haven't touched in a while. I encourage you to implement your favorite language!

Disclaimer some of these probably don't work, it would be ridiculous for me to test this code and I haven't touched most of these languages for quite a while, so please don't read too much into them.
